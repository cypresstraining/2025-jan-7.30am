1.How to use cypress play ground to locate the element 

in the test runner there is  spy icon to enable the play ground 
and on the particular element we need to click on it . to get the right cypress command to locate it .
Locate the element with the cypress play ground
perform an action 
add an assertion => should()
 
2. enable the cypress studio => record and play back 


experimentalStudio: true in cypress.config.js file 

it enabled a torch icon just beside the test suite and test case. 
Testsuite(describe)  => create a new test
Test case (it)=>add a new step 

if you click on AUT then location of the element, action both will be recorded 
if you right click and select respective assertion 
exist or not 
enable or not 
have.text - Expected text
contain -  expected text 
have.class - expected classname 
etc...
======================================================

Test isolation => every test will start from scratch .
no previous test results carry forward to the current test.
every test is independent by default 


Tests should always be able to be run independently from one another and still pass.

by default cypress test isolation is true , hence every test will start independently 

if you change this to false - in cypress.config.js file then 
    testIsolation:false,

your previous test results are carry forwarded to your current test 
// we revisit this concept after basics of cypress is done 
=> cy.session()
cy.clock()
etc...
===============================================
only specific test case we executed through it.only()

how to exclude the it block from the test run
