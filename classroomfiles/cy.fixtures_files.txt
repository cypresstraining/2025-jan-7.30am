cy.fixture() // is a method to read the data from xternal file 

.json // cypress 

Assign an alias for later use. Reference the alias later within a cy.get() or cy.wait() command with a @ prefix. You can alias DOM elements, routes, stubs and spies.
cy.get('#username').as('userId')
cy.get('@userId') //usage of aliasing 
cy.fixture('example.json').as('testdata') // in future you can your example.json file data with the help of testdata 

difference between fixture() /readFile () 

fiture() do not have log :true 
readfile() do log the step in the execution pane 

fixture() load the data before test and maintain the same data across the test. even though you change some thing it does not effect the execution 

readFile() => load the data once again if some test  got failed and get the latest data to make it pass. 

as // aliasing with the help of 
function() // instead of arrow funcitons 
this.testData.name // this is how to retrieve the value of the testData object 

cy.fixture().as() 
cy.fixture().then(function(data) {
this.data=data
})

cy.readFile().as() //dynamically load the data before each step or assertion 
cy.readFile().then(function($data){
this.data=data
})
