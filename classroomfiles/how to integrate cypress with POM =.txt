how to integrate cypress with POM => 

1. created a class file with different selectors belongs to that page 

2. export the class 

3. create a test spec  => cy.js file 

4. import the class - page selectors we need to use with the help  of the import 
5. create an object 
6. retrieve all the selectors whenever it is required with the help of object 
7. this provided extra security - easy readability 
easily maintainable 

adding custom keywords => 
predefine own keyword which we can reuse - 

support  >> commnds.js 

Data driven frame work 

we need to get the test data from external sources

.json 
.csv  => neat-csv plugin 

fixtures => read file /write file +  cy.fixture() 

========================================================

Now in addition to the above activities we need to implement BDD frame work - 

cucumber  -

=> Business people  => feature files 
.feature 

Feature  One line sentence about your feature 
scenario what condition  you are suppose to develop or test 
Given to describe the pre requisites to be complete before your action 

When   actual action to be performed 

Then expected outcome 

AND more conditions or actions to be performed added with AND 
but additional condition 


nopcommerce Login 

nopcommerceLogin.feature 
cypress >> e2e >> cucumber >> features
nopcommerceLogin.feature 

Feature  Login feature 
Scenario Customer login with valid credentials 

Given customer must be on Login screen 
When  Customer enter correct username 
AND customer enter correct password 
AND customer click on Login 
Then Login should be successful and customer is able to see Logout 

Now second part of your job . Create step definitions to the above feature file . 
=> cypress >> e2e >> cucumber >>step_definitons
another folder with name of the feature file 

nopcommerceLogin => folder Name 
=> JavaScript file to create the step definition with same 
nopcommerceLogin_stepDefinitons.js 

import {Given , when , Then } from cypress-cucumber-preprocessor/steps  

Import  className from cypress/e2e/cucumber/pages/pagename.js 

Given('customer must be on Login screen',function(){

cy.visit('https://nopcommerce.com')
cy.contains('SignIn').click()

})
When('Customer enter correct username',function(){
cy.get('#Email').clear().type('admin@yourstore.com')

})
When('Customer enter correct Password',function(){

cy.get('#password').clear().type('adminadmin')

})

When('click on Login button',function(){

cy.get('.submitbutton').click()

})
 
Then('Login should be successful and customer is able to see Logout 
',function(){

cy.contains('Logout').should('be.visible')
cy.contians('Logout').click()
cy.url().should('eq','https://nopcomerce')

})


1. setup your cypress.config.js file 

const cucumber =require('cypress-cucumber-preprocessor') 


2. setup the your package.json file 


=> install the cypress -cucumber-preprocessor  
npm install --save-dev cypress-cucumber-preprocessor 
=> configure your cypress.config.js file 

const cucumber = require('cypress-cucumber-preprocessor').default

 navigate to setupnodeevvent sections and paste the below information 
 on('file:preprocessor', cucumber())

we need to let cypress know which files it needs to consider
