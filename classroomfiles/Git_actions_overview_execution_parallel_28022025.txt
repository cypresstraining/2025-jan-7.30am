We are understanding how to run your test scripts in CI pipeline with parallel execution. 

Step#1 we need to identify which CI tool we need to use . 
GitActions  => Github as  their version control system. 

Github account is the pre requsite . 
in your repository we do have Actions Tab
in this Actions Tab we do have Workflow => 

As part of your Repository integration with gitactions => 
.github/workflows/cypress.yml  this file directs your cypress app or test runner how to do continuous integration with the gitactions.

1. Name of the Test 
2. When it needs to be triggered
3. Jobs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest - which os 
a.  matrix:
        containers: [1, 2] # Uses 2 parallel instances
        containers: [1,2,3] # Uses 3 paralle instances to execute your tests 

b. parallel: true 

          parallel: true # Runs test in parallel using settings above


we can able to execute your tests parallely to reduce time 
test isiolation 

1. Cypress cloud integration - withoutci
2. cypress cloud integration with CI + github + Teams+JIRA 
3. We will start with POM - export and import we would like to use the same concept

4. BDD frame work 

5. Allurereports -  we can integrate it 

6. DB queries through the Cypress by using cy.task() 

=> I will upload couple of example spec files in to your repositroy which demonistrate couple of UI elements like calendar / paginations etc..

=> API testing with the help of cy.request() 
methods:
get
post
patch
put 
delete methods in the API testing 

status codes : 
200
504
404 

basic idea about postman = manual testing tool 
the same thing we can automate with cypress
