Cypress - SQL server - Ecommerce application 

CRUD operation on your application 
create data => create table table name
retrieve data => select data table 
where conditions 
joins 

update data => insert columns table name data 
delete data => delete the data from table 

Data validations => 

your actions through the apis or back end services - saved data correctly or not we can validate with the help of queries 
select * from table table name 
select * from customer 
select customername from customer 
select customerName,customer age, customer salary from customer 
select * from orders 
select * from orders where order_date="current_Date"


SQL => 
APIs=> 



by default cypress do not have this capacity to handle directly with databases .
cy.task()  to deal with this

supply Data base server details in cypress.config.js file 

by using plugin supported procedure or steps will do the connection like how you do through the ms sql server in our local computer. 

server is located 
authentications with username and password 

as per the plugin developer helping document we can connect with the DB
by using above steps .

once connection is established we can make a query with the provided methods in the plugin . 

1. install the plugin - cypress-sqlserver
why because we are using the sqlserver database 

2. import the required settings into the cypress.config.js 
3. import SQlserver from 'cypress-sqlserver' in e2e.js 
4. write a query to the databse with the help of 
cy.sqlserver('mention your query here ').then(function(results) {
expect(results).not.to.be.empty
expect(results). all your assertions will applicable here 


})


learn your SQL queries to implement this .
