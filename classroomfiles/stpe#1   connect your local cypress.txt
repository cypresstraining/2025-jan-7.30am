stpe#1 :  connect your local cypress app with cypress cloud 
a. projectID 
b. record key 

by using above two options -  we can run your test locally with below command
1.  projectId: "yo9zrb", 
2.  npx cypress run --record --key 628164df-6aa9-422e-b64a-bdfe8b7b77dd

CI => continuous integration => you can commit the automation code to the repository . 
=> whenever we commit the code to the repository or scheduled intervals => code will build automatically and run automatically provide the result . 

=> GitHub actions 
=> Jenkins 
=> bitbucket
=> gitlabs 
etc...
but also we do parallel execution to save your execution time 
1 machine - 12 hours 
2 machines - 6.30 hours 
4 machines - 3.15 min 
8 machines -  1h30min
16 machines - 45mins 
all tests are independent - test isolation 
CI => based on commit auto executed your tests
so that new code change related results we can evaluate to understand any broken code. 

this to parallel execution as well 
GitHub actions  => CI tool to provide continuous integration and parallel execution 

Step#2: 
Login to your GitHub repository - 
Set CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY in your GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets → Actions:


Step#3: integrate JIRA 

pre requisite :  JIRA URL for your project - owner of the project

then install the cypress app from atlasian market place 
and configure your project for that JIRA URL 
=> 
Cloud integration with JIRA, teams, GitHub and gitactions
