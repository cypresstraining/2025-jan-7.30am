Cypress with advanced concepts 

shadow dom : 
There are some bits of shadow DOM terminology to be aware of:

Shadow host: The regular DOM node that the shadow DOM is attached to.
Shadow tree: The DOM tree inside the shadow DOM.
Shadow boundary: the place where the shadow DOM ends, and the regular DOM begins.
Shadow root: The root node of the shadow tree.
