Recap: 
We are trying to understand  what is iframe ?
difficulty in tracingout the iframe with cypress?
fix for iframe elements locating through cypress

todo -so we would like create internal http-application to start with very basics. 
=> we need to setup our own local server with sample html 
<htm>

<iframe> </iframe>
cypress will stop here and not able to locate the element which inside of the iframe tag.

</html>

to do so to traceout this problem clearly we created our own application to test it 
.html file you can open this file with the help of browser. 

if there is a webtable in your project - 

table  -  rows and columns 
<tbody> entire table represents 
<tr> table row 
<th> table row heading 
<td>table data 

we can locate data exist in a table 

2. what iframe => 
why do we require a iframe . 
I create a table with some data . in my webtable.html file 
192.168.1.2:8080/webtable.html 

I want to utilise this webtable.html in my another application or page 

192.168.1.2:8080/iframe.html 
with in this page I want to call the above webtable.html
<iframe>192.168.1.2:8080/webtable.html  </iframe> 

this tag will publish in webtable in a frame 
 Rendering another page with in your webpage.
through url => 

as it is in side of  the iframe I can not move further into iframe without having proper test steps in cypress.

to do so we installed npm install cypress-iframe 
a. cy.frameLoaded() to load this iframe for testing 
b. cy.iframe() is used to locate the element with in the loaded frame .
cy.iframe() is like a cy.get() 
.find() 
. should() 

alternative to the plugin - 

we need to use jquery methods to load the iframe. 
cy.get('iframe[type="xyz"]')//specific selector to locate the element 
.then(($iframe)=>{
//contains method from jquery to retrieve content of the 
the frame. 

let iframeBody =$iframe.contains('body') //javascript code
cy.wrap('iframeBody').find().should() // convert js code into cypress subject 
iframeBody

})

html pages = 2
we want to put them in a server  => 
http-server  => 
1. 
2. http://localhost:8080/webtable.html 


in your project root folder => install http-server
=> npm install http-server 
this will install the http-server in your project directory

=> npx http-server 


Steps to automate your local web application by using cypress-

1. install the http-server => npm install http-server
2. launch the application => npx http-server 
you can see the application URL in the terminal outcome 
copy the URL  http://192.168.29.238:8081
3. create a test suite with describe()with in it 
use cy.visit(' http://192.168.29.238:8081')// launch the application in the cypress 
4. npx cypress open 
5. select your test 
6. run the test
7. evaluate the results and debug if any failure
