Variable declaration - 
var => outdated
let  => variables
const => fixed 
=> block scope 

{} => if you declare a variable then 
you can not redeclare the let , const 
you can reassign the value for let and not for const 

hoisting : Js 
we can move all declarations to the top of the block or file 

either you can type all declaration at top of the script or block 

if not JS will do these things 

var x; declaration => hoisting 
x=10; initialization => not hoisting 

let x; declaration => hosting 
x=10; initialization => not hoisting  => without initialization let will not use the variable value 
const x; declaration => hoisting 
x=10; initialization => hot hoisting  => 
let and const =>  without initialization we were not able to use the value before initialization. hence it through a reference error.
