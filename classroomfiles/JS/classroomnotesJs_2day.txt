Good Morning !!!!!

We are understanding the JS : 
1. variable declaration 
a. var
b. let 
c. const 
var name;  is the declaration 
var name="ram" ; is the initialization of the value 
name="prasad"
re declare is possible with var 
re assigning the value is possible with var

let x;
let x=10; is not possible - reference error - redeclaration is not possible with let 
let y;
 y=10; assigning the value => 
re assignment is -possible 

const pi; => is not possible 
const pi=3.14 ; 
pi=4.14 => this is also not possible 

if value will changes in future that should be let
if value will be fixed even in future there should not be any change then that is const .
